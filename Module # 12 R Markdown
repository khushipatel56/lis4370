# Introduction

To make data processing and visualization easier, the `KPatel` package offers statistical and machine learning techniques. This page describes the main features of the package, together with their inputs, outputs, and examples of how to use them.

## Installation

To install and load the package, use:

```r
# Install from GitHub (once uploaded)
# devtools::install_github("khushipatel56/KPatel")

library(KPatel)
```

## Functions

### **1. `categorize_data()`**
**Purpose:** Categorizes numerical data into bins based on predefined intervals.

**Inputs:**
- `data` (data frame): The dataset containing numeric variables.
- `column` (string): The name of the column to categorize.
- `bins` (numeric vector): The breakpoints for categorization.
- `labels` (character vector): Labels for the categories.

**Output:** A modified dataset with an additional categorical column.

**Example Usage:**
```r
categorized_df <- categorize_data(mtcars, "mpg", bins = c(10, 15, 20, 30), 
                                  labels = c("Low", "Medium", "High"))
head(categorized_df)
```

### **2. `train_model()`**
**Purpose:** Trains a machine learning model using the specified algorithm.

**Inputs:**
- `formula` (formula): Model formula.
- `data` (data frame): Training dataset.
- `method` (string): Model type (e.g., `"rf"` for random forest, `"lm"` for linear model).
- `tuneGrid` (optional, data frame): Grid of hyperparameters for tuning.

**Output:** A trained model object.

**Example Usage:**
```r
model <- train_model(mpg ~ ., mtcars, method = "rf")
print(model)
```

---

### **3. `test_hypothesis()`**
**Purpose:** Performs hypothesis testing (e.g., t-test, chi-square test) on the dataset.

**Inputs:**
- `data` (data frame): The dataset.
- `var1`, `var2` (string): The variables for the test.
- `test_type` (string): `"t.test"`, `"chisq.test"`, etc.

**Output:** A summary of the test results.

**Example Usage:**
```r
result <- test_hypothesis(mtcars, "mpg", "hp", test_type = "t.test")
print(result)
```

# Challenges & Improvements

While developing the `KPatel` package, a few challenges were encountered:
- Optimizing categorical binning for different datasets.
- Improving model selection flexibility.
- Ensuring hypothesis tests handle different data types.

Planned improvements include enhancing parameter tuning options and integrating additional machine learning models.
